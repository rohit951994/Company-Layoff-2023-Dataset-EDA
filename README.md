Detailed Analysis of Company Layoff 2023 Dataset .

As we all are hearing almost every day that tech firms around the globe are fighting the economic slowdown by firing employees . The slow consumer spending, higher interest rates by central banks and strong dollars overseas are hinting towards possible recession and tech firms have mainly resulted laying employees off. This economic slowdown has made Meta recently fire 13% of its workforce, which amounts to more than 11,000 employees.
So amid all this slowdown and companies firing employees I though of analysing this situation of layoffs and luckily i found a data set on Kaggle
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/swaptr/layoffs-2022 which was apt for this analysis .

I analysed this dataset using python library numpy and pandas , for visualization I used pyplot, seaborn and plotly . After Importing libraries and dataset in jupyter notebook I starting inspecting the data to check if any cleaning I required .
